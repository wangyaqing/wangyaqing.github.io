# About Me

Dr. Yaqing Wang is currently an Associate Professor at the Beijing Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Applications (BIMSA). 
She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2019, under the supervision of Professor Lionel M. Ni and Prof. James T. Kwok. 
From 2019 to 2024, she worked as a Staff Researcher at Baidu Research.
Dr. Wang has published more than 30 papers in top-tier international conferences and journals, including NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD, TheWebConf, SIGIR, IJCAI, EMNLP, TPAMI, JMLR, and TIP, with more than 5200 citations. 
Dr. Wang was named to the World's Top 2% Scientists List in 2024 and 2025. She was also selected for the Beijing Nova Program in 2025.


# Research Interests

Dr. Yaqing Wang's research focuses on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science. She strives to develop refined, data-efficient, and cost-effective scientific solutions to real-world problems.

Her current research interests include:
